        There are two types of scripts I use, GLSL and Javascript. Shaders are compiled in the programs,
        so GLSL scripting is really just a string manipulation before the compilation. It is used in
        <a href="https://curved-ruler.github.io/webgl-sketches/eq/eq.html">eq</a>, it works well. It is also used in the
        <a href="https://curved-ruler.github.io/webgl-sketches/parametric/parametric.html">Parametric surfaces</a>, and
        the trouble is there that the created geometry is made by the vertex shader, it is only on GPU, and it is
        a bit problematic to transfer to the CPU. (Haven't yet tried the transform feedback, which could do the job)

        The other one is JS. I use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function">Function API</a>.
        <br/>
        Small example:
        
        <div class="border vsp">
          <pre class="linen">1<br/>2<br/>3</pre>
          <pre class="code">
let script = "return (a+b)*c;";
let F   = Function('a', 'b', 'c', script);
let res = F(1, 2, 3);</pre>
          <div style="clear:both"></div>
        </div>
        
        Note that both line 2 and 3 can throw exception.
